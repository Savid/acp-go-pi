// Package lifecycle implements the `acp-go.dev/lifecycle` extension: the closed
// event vocabulary, the strict wire decoder, and the reducer that validates one
// ordered session lifecycle stream.
//
// The reducer is deliberately self-contained rather than shared. Independently
// written reducers reaching the same verdict on the canonical fixture battery is
// what proves the wire contract is unambiguous; a shared package would prove
// only that one implementation agrees with itself.
//
// It reduces the whole event set, including events this adapter's configuration
// never emits, because the same code validates this adapter's own emitted
// stream: a validator that only handles what the harness happens to produce
// cannot detect the case where the harness produces something else.
