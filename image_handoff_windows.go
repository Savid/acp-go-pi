// handoffOpenFlags adds no flags on Windows, which exposes neither a
// symlink-refusing nor a non-blocking open mode here. The handoff form is
// unreachable on this platform anyway, because every file:///C:/... spelling
// fails filepath.IsAbs once FromSlash has run; leaving it unreachable is
// preferable to half-enabling it without a containment story for DOS device
// names. The descriptor identity re-check still runs.
